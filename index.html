         <p id="first">
          My name is Ashanti Benons! I was born on May 25,2002 in Georgetown, Guyana and moved to the United States at the age of three. When I arrived in United States with my parents we lived with my aunt and her family in
         California. After a year we moved to New York and lived with my uncle for a couple months before finally moving into our own apartment. I currently live with my parents Dawn and Nigel Benons 
         in Brooklyn NY.Although i don't have any siblings, I have a close relationship with my cousins as i live very close to them.
         I am currently 15 years old, in the tenth grade and attend Medgar Evers College Preparatory School in Brooklyn, NY.  
         My favorite subject in school has always been science and I am passionate about biology and chemistry. This school year as a result of my computer science A course,
         I have become increasingly interested in the field of computer science and enrolled in the New York on Tech Program in order to gain experience what It would be like to work in the technology
         field. Although I have not made up my mind about what I want subject I want to persue when I go to college, I have my eyes set on going into a medical, computer science or engineering majors.
       Outside of school, I have many hobbies which include reading , writing and drawing. I am passionate about music and enjoy a wide variety of different types of music such as rock, pop, electronic and classical. I also enjoy watching action
         and adventure movies such as the Marvel Superhero movies. I also enjoy nature and taking trips to parks, zoos, aquariums.

             <span><strong>Significant Projects </strong></span>
             <p>Throughout my high school career, I have written a papers to significant lenght that I am proud of.
             During my Sophomore year, I took AP Seminar and learned how to conduct college level research and write 
             comprehensive research reports specializing in specific topics. One of my most significant papers was my IWA
             that dealt with the impact that False Eyewitness Identifications in the criminal justice system has had on American
             Society.</p>

            <span><strong>Internships and Out of School Programs</strong></span>
            <p>During my sophomore year of high school, I participated in New York on Tech's 360 Squad Program.
            During their 10 week spring session, I learned the basic fundamentals of web design including how to
            design web pages using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. A major project that I completed during the program
            was designing a web page for a mock client in a group of 4 peers. My group and I were assigned with a Tutoring Company named Initiative.
            After designing the web site, We had to present it to the class. This year, I have decided to expand my coding knowledge 
            by participating in the second tier program known as Tech Flex Leaders. In this Program, I will be designing more websites and will be given
            the opportunity to tour other technology companies such as Twitter and Facebook.</p>

             <span><strong>Extracurriculars</strong></span>
             <p>I am currently the Co-Founder and Co-President of my school's Robotics Team Robo-Sythesis. Students at my school previously
             competed in robotics competitions through the Steam Program that my school is afiliated with. However, during the summer before
             my junior year I decided that having an official robotics club at the school would give both middle schoolers and high schoolers
             interested in STEM exposure to careers in these fields. After talking with several teachers and parents at my school, I had found
             mentors who could advise the team and funding for building materials that we could use. Currently, my responsibilities
             in the club include advertising the club and encouraging students to join, explaining how the club will operate to new members
             and planning out and explaning the agenda to club meetings. The plan for the club is for the team to enter the First Tech Challenge
             and to compete in as many robotics competitions as possible.</p>

            <p>I am currently Co-Chair of Leadership in my school's National Honor Society.
            In addition to attending and speaking at monthly cabinet meetings, I am responsible for creating
            and executing the Peer Mentorship Program at my school. In this program, Current NHS members and other high schoolers take on the
            responsibility of mentoring a middle schooler who is in need of academic assistance or other forms of 
            guidance. As an NHS cabinet member, I also interview prospective candidates for induction into the program and
            review applications to decide who will get accepted. </p>
